End User License Agreement

Read carefully this End User License Agreement (the "Agreement") before using Samsung manufactured or branded wearable devices compatible with Samsung mobile devices such as Gear and Gear Fit series (collectively, “Wearable Device”), and Samsung wearable device manager applications compatible with Samsung mobile devices (collectively, “Manager”) as it contains important information. 
This Agreement is a legal agreement between you (either an individual or a single entity) and Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (“Samsung”) for software, owned by Samsung and its affiliated companies and its third party suppliers and licensors, that accompanies this Agreement, which includes software and associated media, printed materials, “online” or electronic documentation in connection with your use of the Wearable Device and/or the Manager (collectively “Software”). 

The Manager is a software program to connect your mobile device (the “Device”) to Wearable Device and let you manage, control or update the software of the Wearable Device through the Device. The Wearable Device requires the use of preloaded software in its normal operation.  By using the Wearable Device, the Manager or its preloaded software, you accept the terms of this Agreement.  If you do not accept these terms, do not use the Wearable Device, the Manager or its preloaded software. 
1. Grant of License
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, you are granted a limited non-exclusive, revocable license to install, use, access, display and run one copy of the Manager on a single Wearable Device. You may not make the Manager available over a network where it could be used by multiple Wearable Devices at the same time.
Certain items of the Software may be subject to open source licenses.  The open source license provisions may override some of the terms of this Agreement.

Samsung may provide to you or make available to you Software updates to the Wearable Device (the “Update”), including without limitation bug fixes, service upgrades, upgrades and enhancements to any software previously installed in your Wearable Device. To use the version provided through such Update, you must first be licensed for the software eligible for Update.
